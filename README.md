# Realtime_FaceRecognition
Real time face recognition system using Python, OpenCV and Keras

After having completed the Specialization course in Deep Learning by coursera, I wanted to build a few applications on my own to understand the working of DNN models better since the course provided us with pretrained models and we have prebuilt functions for most of the challening parts.
One such application was face recognition using ONE SHOT LEARNING.
I have been working on building a face detection system, currently training the network using MegaFace Dataset http://megaface.cs.washington.edu/dataset/download.html

The modules uploaded are my first ever attempt to develop Face recognition using a small dataset.
The updated system and results will posted soon ..



Here is a list of all the papers, refered during the project:
